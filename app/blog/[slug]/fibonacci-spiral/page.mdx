## The Beauty of the Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a fascinating mathematical concept where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. So, it goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

One of the most visually appealing representations of this sequence is the **Fibonacci spiral**. We can create this by drawing squares whose side lengths correspond to the Fibonacci numbers and then drawing quarter-circle arcs connecting the corners of these squares. The result is a beautiful logarithmic spiral that appears frequently in nature, from seashells to galaxies.

## Interactive Visualization

Below is an interactive visualization of the Fibonacci spiral built using React and the HTML Canvas API. It's a **Client Component** because it needs access to browser features (like the canvas) and uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage the animation and user interaction.

You can adjust the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence used to generate the spiral and watch it draw segment by segment.

{/* Embed the interactive Client Component here */}

<div className="my-8 flex justify-center">
  {/* Optional centering container */}
  <FibonacciSpiral />
</div>

### How it Works

1.  **Fibonacci Generation:** A simple function generates the required number of Fibonacci terms.
2.  **Canvas Setup:** A `canvas` element is rendered, and we get its 2D drawing context using `useRef`.
3.  **Drawing Logic:** The `drawSpiralAnimated` function calculates the position and radius for each arc based on the Fibonacci numbers and the current drawing direction (right, down, left, up). It uses `setTimeout` to create the animation effect, drawing one arc segment at a time.
4.  **Scaling:** The drawing scale is adjusted based on the number of terms to keep the spiral reasonably centered and visible within the canvas.
5.  **Client Component:** The `use client` directive at the top of the component file tells Next.js to handle this component differently, allowing it to use browser-specific APIs and hooks.

This example demonstrates how you can seamlessly integrate interactive, client-side components directly into your server-rendered MDX blog posts within the Next.js App Router.

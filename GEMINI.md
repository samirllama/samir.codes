### Theme Implementation Updates (July 1, 2025)

This section details the recent updates to the application's theme implementation, focusing on dynamic text and background colors for the menu and header components, and the introduction of new global CSS variables for enhanced theme awareness.

#### 1. Dynamic Text Color Logic

To ensure optimal readability and visual contrast, the text color within the menu and certain header elements now dynamically adjusts based on the active theme.

**Changes Made:**
- **`app/styles/theme.css`**:
    - Introduced two new CSS variables:
        - `--color-menu-bg`: Defined as black (`oklch(0% 0 0)`) in the light theme (`:root`) and white (`oklch(100% 0 0)`) in the dark theme (`.dark`).
        - `--color-menu-text`: Defined as white (`oklch(100% 0 0)`) in the light theme (`:root`) and black (`oklch(0% 0 0)`) in the dark theme (`.dark`).
- **`tailwind.config.ts`**:
    - Added `menu-bg` and `menu-text` to the `theme.extend.colors` section, allowing these CSS variables to be used as Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `bg-menu-bg`, `text-menu-text`).
- **`components/ui/app-menu.tsx`**:
    - The `menuContentClasses` now uses `text-menu-text` to ensure the menu's text color always contrasts with its background.
    - The hover underline effect for navigation items within the menu now uses `bg-menu-text` for consistent contrasting visuals.
- **`components/ui/header.tsx`**:
    - The `headerBStyles` now dynamically applies `text-menu-text` when the menu is open and `text-text-default` when the menu is closed. This ensures the logo and hamburger icon colors invert to contrast with the menu's background when it's active.

#### 2. Enhanced Menu Background Logic

The menu's background now consistently contrasts with the main application's theme, providing a black background in light mode and a white background in dark mode.

**Changes Made:**
- **`components/ui/app-menu.tsx`**:
    - Both `blackOverlayClasses` and `lightBackgroundPanelClasses` now utilize `bg-menu-bg`. This ensures a unified background color for the menu, which dynamically changes based on the theme to provide the desired contrast.
    - The `visible` and `invisible` classes were removed from `menuContainerClasses` to ensure smoother CSS transitions for the menu's appearance and disappearance, resolving a "jerk" effect during closing.

#### 3. Leveraging Global Variables for Theme Awareness

The introduction of `--color-menu-bg` and `--color-menu-text` as global CSS variables, exposed through Tailwind CSS, provides a powerful mechanism for extending theme awareness across the application.

**How to Leverage:**
- **Consistent Styling**: Any component that needs to adopt the menu's contrasting color scheme (e.g., a modal, a tooltip, or a specific section that should visually pop against the main theme) can now directly use `bg-menu-bg` for its background and `text-menu-text` for its text.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Instead of hardcoding colors or creating complex conditional logic, developers can simply apply these Tailwind classes, and the colors will automatically resolve based on the active theme.
- **Extensibility**: If new UI elements are introduced that require the same contrasting behavior as the menu, these variables can be readily applied, ensuring a consistent design language throughout the application.

This approach centralizes theme-related color definitions, making the codebase more maintainable, scalable, and visually consistent across different themes.
